        <h2>and now a little about the zone</h2>
                <p>There are 4 zones in total.
                    blue, yellow, red, black.  They differ in that they have different tiers (levels) of resources and something else that I’ll write about now...</p>

                <p>Blue Zone - Blue zones range from 1 to 4 levels. There is no PvP in these zones (a duel between two
                     players does not count), that is, in these zones it is impossible to damage a player, and there are a 
                     maximum of 4 resource levels. some have static dungeons (static dungeons) they are also 4 levels</p>

                <p>Yellow zone - in the yellow zone everything doesn’t change much, resources are level 5, as well as static and dungeons.
                    But with pvp it’s not the same, there are already those who can PUT you ON YOUR KNEES and not kill you, but if they put 
                    you on your knees, then the percentage of your armor decreases by 5%, but this can be avoided simply by not hitting players 
                    with a red nickname as I call (aggressors)</p>

                <p>Red zones - here you can already get level 6 resources and here it becomes dangerous, because if the player kills you, you will die. but the good (aggressors) are shown at the bottom right (red diamond).

                    mobs bring you to your knees for 10 seconds, but if there was a player with a red nickname next to you at that moment, then 
                    the knockout will last 3 minutes, and the same player can finish you off, thereby receiving your resources with armor</p>

                <p>Black Zones - this is where complexity and richness begin. These zones are not on royal land, so to get into them you need to go into the portal and there they will be from tier 5 to 8,
                    The nicknames of the players in these zones are all red and everyone can kill you and get your resources. Therefore, I do not
                     recommend going there for those who have just started playing and are just learning the game.</p>
